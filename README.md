# OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch for ns-3

This is an [OpenFlow 1.3][ofp13] compatible user-space software switch implementation, forked from the original [CPqD OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch][cpqdofs13] and slightly modified to proper integration with the [ns-3 Network Simulator][ns-3]. This code does not modify the original switch datapath implementation, which is currently maintained in the original repository and regularly synced to the master branch on this one. The modified `ns3lib` branch includes some callbacks, compiler directives and minor changes in struct declarations to allow integration with the `OFSwitch13` module for the ns-3. 

Please, visit the `OFSwitch13` [project homepage][ofswitch13] for detailed information on the module design, documentation, and *how to get started* tutorials.

# Contribute
Please, consider submitting your bug reports to the original [CPqD OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch project][cpqdofs13].

This code is released under the BSD license (BSD-like for code from the original Stanford switch).

# Acknowledgments
Thanks to the original [CPqD OpenFlow 1.3 Software Switch][cpqdofs13] contributors. Special thanks to [Eder Le√£o Fernandes][ederlf], for contributing to the integration between this software switch and the ns-3 simulator.
