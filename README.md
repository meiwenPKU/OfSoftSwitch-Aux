This repository is based on <https://github.com/CPqD/ofsoftswitch13>, and some of the source codes are modified to make the library to support multiple auxiliary connections between the switch and the controller (In the original liberary, only one main connection and one auxiliary connection between the switch and the controller are supported). With this modification, it can be integrated with ns3 to support SDN simulations where multiple auxiliary connections are built between the switch and the controller.
